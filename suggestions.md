# Learn365 - Suggestions

Penetration Testing is a vast ocean and thinking of new topics everyday is sometimes quite a difficult task. However, with the help of amazing community, the steak will keep going. If you know any nice topic to work on, study or research about, please add them to the below list so that I can pick them up once I am exhausted out of topics. Please note that at the moment, I am not planning to pick some generic topics such as Cross-Site Scripting, Access Controls, Cross-Site Request Forgery, etc. The main idea is to learn something new but there's nothing new on some specific day, I can share my views on such issues just to keep the streak going on. I hope to receive good points from community. Cheers!
